Micropython code for interfacing between  Raspberry Pi Pico and a strip of WS2815s

## Dependancies:
The only dependancy is a Raspberry Pi Pico with [rp2-pico-20210902-v1.17.uf2](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/) or later stable versions
For programming this code, a Micropython linter is reccomended. Pico-Go for Visual Studio Code or similar will work (Remember to initialise project)
